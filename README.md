Using machine learning in heart abnormalities has been highly taken into account due to the fact that
millions of people are suffering all around the world. The genesis of Artificial Intelligence has had a
profound influence on diagnosing cardiovascular disorders. To ensure the robustness of the Machine
Learning models in accurately predicting heart diseases, enhancements are required in terms of
functionality. Therefore, researchers aim to design and evaluate state-of-the-art approaches for better
results. In this project, I implemented a machine learning system that could predict whether a person has
heart disease or not based on their health records. Using the publicly available Cleveland dataset,
various health parameters which correspond to an individual's health records were considered as the
features. Several data preparation and preprocessing steps were carried out to clean and select the
most relevant and informative features. First, data analysis was conducted, demonstrating that the
highest risk of heart disease occurs at the age of approximately 60 years, and the risk of peak disease is
between the heart rate of 140 and 170. Further, several machine learning classifiers, such as K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes, along with Logistic Regression, were trained
using the selected features, and their performances were compared to determine the best approach to
the classification problem. Experimental results illustrate that KNN and GNB classifiers have best
performed and reached a classification accuracy of 86.81% and %87.12, respectively, in detecting heart
diseases.
